# Code-to-Speech: A Developer Assistant

# Overview

Have you ever wondered how a visually impaired developer would debug his or her code?

Our Code-to-Speech is an accessibility-focused tool that aims to support visually impaired developers by reading source code aloud in a clear manner. By turning code into speech, this tool promotes inclusivity in software development and ensures that programming remains accessible to all. As common with tools like this, non-visually impaired developers can also use it to review or debug their code while multitasking. For example, a developer could listen to his or her code and try to figure out where a particular error is emanating from whilst eating or even bathing.

# Features

Multiple Language Support: This tool currently supports Python and other Python-like languages. Additionally, it can read the code aloud in English, Spanish, French, or German.

Speed Control: The reading pace can be adjusted

Downloadable File: This tool also allows you to download the audio file to listen offline. And maybe share with a friend, colleague, or collaborator
